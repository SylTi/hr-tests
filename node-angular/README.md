# Instructions:

Create a function that checks if the email submitted by the form is from a disposable email service provider (i.e. yopmail.com). This check can be done on the client side (in IndexCtrl) or on the server side (in the / POST route) or both. You can use a node module or a library if you find one, as well as using lists of disposable email providers.
